# 📚 Diario dei Libri

Mobile application developed with **React Native (Expo)** for managing a personal library:  
book cataloging, categories and subcategories, reading status, ratings, and comments.

The app is **published on the Google Play Store** and works fully offline.

👉 **Play Store:** Currently under review / publishing

## 🎯 Repository purpose

This repository is intended **for portfolio purposes only**.

It is meant to showcase:
- project structure
- React Native / TypeScript code quality
- component organization
- separation of UI, logic, and data layers
- architectural approach (repository pattern)

It is **not** intended to be an open-source project nor a reusable application base.

---

## 🧱 Tech stack

- React Native
- Expo
- TypeScript
- SQLite (in the production app)
- Component-based architecture
- Repository pattern

---

## 🗄️ Data layer (important note)

The **real persistence layer (SQLite)** is **not included** in this repository.

The public project contains only:
- **types**
- **interfaces**
- **mock implementations**

This allows to:
- clearly showcase the application architecture
- keep the project compilable
- avoid exposing the full business and persistence logic

> The real SQLite implementation is intentionally excluded.  
> This repository exposes interfaces and mock implementations for portfolio purposes only.
